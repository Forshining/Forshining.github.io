Welcome to my personal website! Now I'm an undergraduate student majoring in statistics in School of Mathematics at Sun-Yat-Sen University and a coming master majoring in Computer Science, fortunately under the supervision of [Prof. Ling Qing](http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~qingling/).

My research interests lie broadly in differential privacy, machine learning theory, high-dimensional statistics and optimization.

If you have any questions with my blogs and projects, please contact me via email and I'll be glad to have a further discussion with you!

My [Curriculum Vitae](https://github.com/Forshining/forshining.github.io/files/11175649/SYSU_CV_Zihui_Weng.pdf) is here.
