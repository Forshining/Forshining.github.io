Welcome to my personal website! Now I'm an undergraduate student majoring in statistics in School of Mathematics at Sun-Yat-Sen University and a coming master majoring in CS under the supervision of Prof. Ling QING with wide research interest in statistics, machine learning, causal inference and optimization. If you have any questions with my blogs and projects, please contact me via email and I'll be glad to have a further discussion with you!
