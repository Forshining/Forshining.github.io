Welcome to my personal website! Now I'm an undergraduate student majoring in statistics in School of Mathematics at Sun-Yat-Sen University and a coming master majoring in Computer Science, fortunately under the supervision of Prof. Ling Qing<http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~qingling/>.

My research interests lie in the fields of optimization, machine learning theory, statistics and privacy.

If you have any questions with my blogs and projects, please contact me via email and I'll be glad to have a further discussion with you!
