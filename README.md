Welcome to my personal website! Now I'm master student majoring in Computer Science at Sun Yat-sen University, fortunately under the supervision of Jianhuang Lai.

My current research focuses on security and privacy in machine learning, espcially in foundation models. I am also interested in the intersection of computer vision and computer graphics.

If you have any questions with my blogs and projects, please contact me via email and I'll be glad to have a further discussion with you!
