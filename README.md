Welcome to my personal website! Now I'm an undergraduate student majoring in statistics in School of Mathematics at Sun-Yat-Sen University and a coming master majoring in Computer Science, fortunately under the supervision of Prof. Jianhuang Lai.

My current research focuses on security and privacy in machine learning theoretically and empirically, espcially in foundation models utilizing tools from high-dimensional statistics, optimization and theoretical machine learning, etc.

If you have any questions with my blogs and projects, please contact me via email and I'll be glad to have a further discussion with you!
